# Verilog-Project-Async-Adder
Testing Verilator Capabilities

One module design which takes in two 8 bit numbers and adds them, resulting in a 9 bit output. The testbench does random combinations of inputs a and b to test the 
adder.

Between the first 2 projects, both clocked, and non-clocked designs have worked so far with Verilator, so I will now start looking into more interesting 
Verilog projects to learn the language in more depth
